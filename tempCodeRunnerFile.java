// In the above example, the `Animal` class has a method `makeSound()`, which is overridden in the `Dog` class. 
// When we create an instance of `Dog`, the `makeSound()` method in the `Dog` class is invoked, providing a different
//  implementation. Additionally, when we assign a `Dog` object to an `Animal` reference, the overridden method in the
// `Dog` class is still invoked, demonstrating dynamic method dispatch.
